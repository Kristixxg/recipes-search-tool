# lets-stay-in

## Description 

Have the ultimate date night in with Let's Stay In. A collaborative effort to cirrate the perfect night in. Let's Stay In will help you pick a recipe based on the main ingredient, cook time, and dietary needs. Entertainment is randomly generated, along with an Techy phrase to impress your date.
JavaScript is our main technology used, along with HTML and CSS. Libraries that were introduced in this project were Foundation and Animate.CSS. Foundation and Animate.CSS were used for adding styles and movement to the page. Foundation modals are generated within JavaScript adding styling with Foundation's CSS class attributes. Modals in Foundation was the biggest challenge at we faced and overcame by adding a call to Foundation within out JavaScript.
Future features we hope to implement would enhance the layout to include a more unique and branded look. Add the ability to take in more recipe and movie search parameters, to create a more tailored user experience.
